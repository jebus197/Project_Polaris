# Project Polaris

Project Polaris is a governance-first framework for coordinated human and AI work.

This repository is the canonical home of the founding principles, constitutional model, and publication drafts.
Owner and project lead: George Jackson.

## Core Constitutional Principles

1. Trust cannot be bought, sold, exchanged, delegated, rented, inherited, or gifted.
2. Trust can only be earned through verified behavior and verified outcomes over time.
3. Machines may earn operational trust, but constitutional voting authority is verified-human only.
4. Human trust is weighted above machine trust in governance-critical decisions.
5. Constitutional control is geographically distributed, supermajority-gated, and anti-capture by design.
6. Trust is bounded: non-zero floor, hard caps, rate limits, and no trust-to-command conversion.

## Governance Clarifications

1. Proof-of-personhood and proof-of-agenthood are supporting anti-abuse controls, not truth or correctness oracles.
2. Cryptographic anchoring proves integrity and provenance of process history; it does not prove correctness by itself.
3. Correctness depends on independent verification and evidence quality.

## Mathematical Governance Core

The formal model is specified in:

1. [Trust Constitution](TRUST_CONSTITUTION.md)
2. [Institutional White Paper (Section 7.6-7.8)](PROJECT_POLARIS_INSTITUTIONAL_WHITE_PAPER.md)

Key elements include:

1. Trust-domain separation (`T_H` and `T_M`).
2. Slow-gain/fast-loss trust dynamics with non-zero floor.
3. Geo-distributed human chamber voting and supermajority ratification.
4. Capture-risk upper-bound model.
5. Bounded trust economy with cryptographic proof-of-trust minting.

## Archival Note

External chat-export source PDFs are archived locally and intentionally excluded from this repository.

## Notes

1. "Project Polaris" is a working title and may change.
2. Constitutional history and amendments are intended to be cryptographically anchored with public traceability.
