# Polaris Work Log (Feb 13, 2026)

Author: George Jackson
Scope: Background review and implications assessment for Project Polaris.

## 1) Objective

Assess the attached background materials and answer:
1. Can the identified issues be addressed?
2. Are the offered perspectives valid?

## 2) Inputs reviewed

1. External background assessment exports (archived locally)
2. Existing project context in:
- `HANDOFF_NOTE.md`

## 3) Method used

1. Read both PDFs in full.
2. Extract and map recurring claims, including risk and security claims.
3. Distinguish:
- valid structural insights
- optimistic/speculative assertions
- actionable mitigations
4. Produce a practical judgment focused on feasibility and design corrections.

## 4) Main findings

1. Polaris concept remains feasible and strategically strong.
2. Most risk concerns are valid and can be addressed through design.
3. Several claims in the source material are overstated and should be reframed.

## 5) Key overstated patterns detected

1. "Bulletproof" timing-gate identity assertions.
2. "Consensus equals truth" assumptions.
3. "Absolute deterrence" and mathematically impossible-failure language.

## 6) Corrective direction captured

1. Keep Candela-style policy/evidence core.
2. Add anti-collusion routing and reviewer diversity.
3. Use evidence-weighted verification, not vote-only logic.
4. Apply risk-tier governance (fast for low-risk, strict for high-risk).
5. Separate governance powers (proposal, approval, enforcement, appeals).

## 7) Outputs created this round

1. Updated `HANDOFF_NOTE.md` with external-review findings.
2. Created `POLARIS_BACKGROUND_REVIEW_2026-02-13.md` with full analysis.
3. Created this file (`POLARIS_WORK_LOG_2026-02-13.md`).
4. Updated both core docs with a non-negotiable constitutional trust rule:
- Trust cannot be bought, sold, exchanged, delegated, rented, or gifted.
- Trust can only be earned through verified behaviour and outcomes over time.

## 8) Status

This review round is complete and recorded for handoff.

## 9) Additional refinements captured later (same date)

1. Identity challenge clarification:
- Proof-of-personhood/proof-of-agenthood retained as supporting anti-abuse controls.
- Explicitly not treated as a standalone truth or correctness oracle.

2. Constitutional anchoring clarification:
- Constitution and amendments are now explicitly defined as hash-anchored public artifacts.

3. Human vs machine trust authority clarified:
- Machines can earn operational trust.
- Constitutional proposal and voting authority remains verified-human only.
- Human trust is weighted above machine trust in governance-sensitive decisions.

4. Anti-capture refinement:
- Added explicit language to block steward concentration from becoming a de facto government.
- Added distributed high-trust human proposal requirements and supermajority ratification constraints.

5. Mathematical governance core added:
- Trust-domain equations, threshold gates, chamber model, geographic constraints, and capture-bound formulation are now documented.

6. Files updated in this refinement round:
- `TRUST_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `PROJECT_POLARIS_PUBLIC_BRIEF.md`
- `PROJECT_POLARIS_INSTITUTIONAL_WHITE_PAPER.md`
- `HANDOFF_NOTE.md`

## 10) Latest refinement round (bounded trust economy)

1. Added bounded-trust constitutional model:
- universal baseline trust for verified identities,
- contribution-only trust growth,
- slow dormancy decay with grace period,
- non-zero trust floor,
- absolute and relative trust caps,
- per-epoch trust growth limit.
- low-trust recovery lane via small verified tasks.
- trust minting only through cryptographic proof-of-trust evidence.

2. Added non-dominance rule:
- trust cannot be converted into direct control over other actors.

3. Added post-money governance rule:
- financial capital has no role in trust gain or constitutional authority.

4. Preserved and clarified existing positions:
- machines can earn operational trust but cannot vote constitutionally,
- proof-of-personhood/proof-of-agenthood is supporting control only,
- cryptography proves integrity/provenance, not truth in isolation.

5. Files updated in this latest round:
- `TRUST_CONSTITUTION.md`
- `PROJECT_POLARIS_PUBLIC_BRIEF.md`
- `PROJECT_POLARIS_INSTITUTIONAL_WHITE_PAPER.md`
- `HANDOFF_NOTE.md`
